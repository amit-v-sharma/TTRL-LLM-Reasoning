    "Welcome to the first lesson in the **End-to-End Test-Time Training** tutorial series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: Memory Bottlenecks\n",
    "Traditional Transformer models (like GPT-4, Llama 3) process text using **Attention**.\n",
    "- To \"remember\" what you said 5 minutes ago, they store a **Key-Value Cache (KV Cache)**.\n",
    "- **Short Context**: This is fine.\n",
    "- **Long Context (1M+ tokens)**: The KV Cache becomes massive. Storing millions of previous tokens in GPU RAM is slow and expensive (Terabytes of RAM needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: \"Context as Weights\"\n",
    "**Test-Time Training (TTT)** proposes a radical shift.\n",
    "Instead of storing the history in a static cache, we **train a neural network** on the history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Old Way (Attention)**: `Memory = [List of past tokens]`\n",
    "- **New Way (TTT)**: `Memory = [Weights of a Model]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"memory\" of the conversation is compressed into the updated weights of this internal network. As a new token arrives, we run a gradient descent step to update these weights.\n",

    "## 1. Defining the TTT Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will build a **Toy Model** from scratch to visualize how weights can be updated on-the-fly during a forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need a custom layer?\n",
    "Standard PyTorch layers (`nn.Linear`) are designed to have fixed weights during inference. We need a layer where the weights (`inner_weights`) are **mutable** and updated *per token*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "1.  **`inner_weights` (The \"Memory\")**: In a standard RNN, the hidden state $h_t$ is a vector. In TTT, the hidden state is a **Matrix** $W_t$ that we learn.\n",
    "2.  **`query`, `key`, `value` projections**: These are fixed weights learned during pre-training. They decide *what* to store in our memory matrix."
