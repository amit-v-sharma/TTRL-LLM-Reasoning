    "# Lesson 1: The Intuition of Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 What is TTRL?\n",
    "Most LLMs are \"frozen\" after training. They generate an answer once, and if it's wrong, it stays wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL)**, or *Inference-Time Compute*, changes this paradigm. Instead of trusting the first answer, we treat the model as a stochastic (random) generator. By letting it \"think\" multiple times and exploring different reasoning paths, we can statistically marginalize out errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lesson:**\n",
    "1.  We connect to your local **Mistral** model via Ollama.\n",
    "2.  We pose a problem famous for tricking human intuition (The **Linda Problem**).\n",
    "3.  We implement **Majority Voting**, the simplest form of TTRL, to fix the model's bias without any training."
